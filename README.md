# Excercise3-GBM
The exercise situation is explained in the problem.txt file.

##How to use
you can use either Ejericici3.py or Ejercicio3UsingFile.py those are almost the same.

With Ejercicio3.py you have to run it in a terminal and the first input is the number
of the amount of inputs you want to write, for each input below the first, the program 
is going to calculate and print the answer of how many jumps you have to do to reach 
the point entered.

For testing and other purposes I recomend to use the Ejercicio3UsingFile.py to avoid 
enter data direct to the console.

Here is a pict of my approach.
